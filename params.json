It uses [framerjs](http://framerjs.com/) as a base framework to resolve touch interactions and animations.\r\n\r\nDue to framerjs restrictions, the app is only supported on webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) at the moment. To run it directly, simply download the project and open index.html in any of these. Make sure local file restrictions are disabled.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
