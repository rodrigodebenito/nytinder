NYTinder is a mobile web app that uses Tinder's UI paradigm (swipe right to like, swipe left to dismiss) to navigate New York Times articles and get personalized suggested stories through a custom version of the [[http://developer.nytimes.com/docs|NYT API]].

The app is in prototype state at the moment and it was developed as part of The New York Times Hack Week of March 2015. It uses [[http://framerjs.com/|framerjs]] as a base framework to resolve touch interactions and animations.
