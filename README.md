NYTinder is a mobile web app that uses Tinder's UI paradigm (swipe right to like, swipe left to dismiss) to navigate New York Times articles and get personalized suggested stories through a custom version of the [NYT API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs).

The app is in prototype state at the moment and it was developed as part of The New York Times Hack Week of March 2015. It uses [framerjs](http://framerjs.com/) as a base framework to resolve touch interactions and animations.
