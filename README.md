NYTinder is a mobile web app that uses Tinder's UI paradigm (swipe right to like, swipe left to dismiss) to navigate New York Times articles and get personalized suggested stories through a custom version of the [NYT API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs).

The app is in prototype state at the moment and it was developed as part of The New York Times Hack Week of March 2015. It uses [framerjs](http://framerjs.com/) as a base framework to resolve touch interactions and animations.

Due to framerjs restrictions, the app is only supported on webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) at the moment. To run it directly, simply download the project and open index.html in any of these. Make sure local file restrictions are disabled.
